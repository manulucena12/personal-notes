# Personal Notes

These are my notes that I've created to help me better understand and retain various technical topics as I learn and grow in my career. They serve as a personal reference and may also be useful to others following a similar path.

> 📝 **Note**: For the moment, I only have AWS notes, but I plan to expand this repository with notes on other technologies and topics over time.
